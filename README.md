# Weather-Dashboard
UConn Bootcamp Chapter 6 Server-Side APIs Challenge

## Description
In this chapter 6 challenge I took my knowledge of Server-Side APIs and used it to create a Weather Dashboard.  I now have a valuable asset to use in my journey towards becoming a web developer as I can use this Weather Dashboard for projects or as a part of my coding portfolio.


## Process
* The first thing I did after creating the repository wasadding in empty base files such as 'index.js', 'style.css', and 'script.js'.

* The next step was to sort out my index.html by contstructing an html skeleton.  I would later add to this using the innerHtml method.  I also had to visit the weather API's website to make an account and create a new API Key.

* Next, through various commits and pushes, I wrote out my script.js.  This was used to give my webpage functionality such as the ability to search by city, save cities to history, and display current weather.

* Finally, I styled my webpage to make it unique and attractive to users.  To do this effectively, I split up my styling into several components such as Global, Header, and UV color.

## Conclusion
Overall, this was a very useful and fun project to work on.  I enjoyed using the 'OpenWeather' API and the action of displaying live weather was very interesting to me.  It was difficult for me to get the some of the functions to be fully functional, but it was all worth it in the end.
